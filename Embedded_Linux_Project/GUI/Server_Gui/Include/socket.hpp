Description:
            -> This file defines the Socket interface (Abstract Class) for socket programming in C++.
            -> It declares pure virtual functions for socket operations such as waiting for a connection,
                sending messages, receiving data, shutting down the socket, and connecting.
            -> This interface is intended to be implemented by specific socket classes for different protocols (TCP/UDP).
