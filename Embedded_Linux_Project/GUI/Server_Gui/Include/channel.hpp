Description:
            ->  This file defines the Channel class, which serves as an abstract base class for communication channels.
            ->  It includes methods for starting, stopping, sending, and receiving messages over a socket.
            ->  The class uses a shared pointer to manage the socket instance, ensuring proper memory management
                and cleanup of derived classes.
            ->  The class is designed to be extended by specific channel implementations, such as ClientChannel or ServerChannel.
