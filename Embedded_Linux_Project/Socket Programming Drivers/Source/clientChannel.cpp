Description:
            -> This file implements the ClientChannel class, which extends the Channel class for client-side communication.
            -> It includes methods for starting, stopping, sending, and receiving messages over a socket.
            -> The class uses a shared pointer to manage the socket instance, ensuring proper memory management
                and cleanup of derived classes.
            -> The class is designed to handle client-specific communication logic, such as connecting to a server and managing 
                client-side operations.
            -> The class is designed to be used in conjunction with the Socket class, which provides the underlying 
                socket functionality.
            -> The class is designed to be extended by specific client implementations, allowing for flexibility in client 
                communication.
            -> The class is intended to be used in network programming scenarios where a client needs to communicate with a server.
